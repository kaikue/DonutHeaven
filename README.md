## TODO

- Ask in discord if anyone wants to draw me an ending screen
	At the end of the game you get back to "Donut Heaven" and reunite with your friends (the two other angels). So I was thinking the ending screen would be the three angels together looking happy. Maybe they're eating donuts or cake or something
	The screen looks like this so it would be just a transparent image to fill up the main space at the top
- Levels- reduced scope
	- Frosted Fields
	- Jelly Swamp
	- Chocolate Mountain
	- Donut Heaven
		- decorations
		- Introduce dash refill crystal?
		- chain together lots of flying moves?
	- Ending art
